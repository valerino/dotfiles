# WSL specific
for Linux on Windows (Linux Subsystem for Windows, WSL), use the provided .zshrc-wsl and .vimrc-wsl as is.

they're stripped versions which works better with WSL, zsh doesn't use zplug but **oh-my-zsh** instead. 

setup vim and tmux as in the main [README](./README.md), then follow https://blog.joaograssi.com/windows-subsystem-for-linux-with-oh-my-zsh-conemu/ to setup ZSH + Oh-My-Zsh.

if you have problems with vim arrow keys, follow https://conemu.github.io/en/BashOnWindows.html#arrows.
